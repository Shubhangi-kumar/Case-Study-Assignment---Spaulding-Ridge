An Employee Compensation Forecasting Application for a mid-sized organization. 

Tools

1. C Language - Used to build logic-driven functionalities such as compensation simulations, data filtering, and CSV file exports. C provided precise control over memory and data structures for handling employee datasets.

2. MySQL Workbench - Employed for managing and querying the employee database. It was used to group data by experience, roles, and locations, and to simulate incremented compensation values efficiently using SQL queries.

3. Microsoft Excel - Utilized for viewing, cleaning, and analyzing raw employee data. Excel supported quick insights through pivot tables and was used to visualize compensation comparisons and verify query outputs.

4. HTML - Used to design simple user interface mockups for data filtering and presentation. It provided a visual layer for simulating user interaction with employee data views and chart representations.
